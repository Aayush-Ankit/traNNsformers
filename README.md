# Structured clustering for memristive crossbar based neuromorphic architectures

## Objective: Reduce the number of crossbars getting mapped to unclustered sunapses.
Approach 2a) Decrease cluster_base_quality_min to form clusteres with lower utilization too.
  Advantage: Existing framework will fill up such crossbars and the new synapses can add to accuracy.
