# traNNsformers
TraNNsformer is an integrated framework for training MLP and CNN networks using structured pruning approach to enable efficient mapping on memristive crossbar based neuromorphic architecures.

## Network Topologies
TraNNsformer framework is implemented to transform mapping of two neural network topologies: 
1- Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) are transformed using codes in <NN>
2- Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) are transformed using codes in <CNN>, if no GPU support is available, or <CNN_wGPU>, if GPU is available for large network configurations.
